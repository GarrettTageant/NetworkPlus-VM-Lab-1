This is the first of several labs putting into practice the knowledge I've learned while studying for the CompTIA Network+ N10-009 certification exam.
This first lab is just to statically assign IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on an end device. I also decided to disable SLAAC and other IPv6 settings.

Here are the steps I took in order:

1. Download VirtualBox
2. Download Windows 10 iso
3. Create the VM with the Windows 10 iso
4. Let Windows 10 install
5. Download nmap in the VM
6. Scan my local network for open ipv4 and ipv6 addresses
7. Statically assign an available ipv4 and ipv6 address

Details to be added later
